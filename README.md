# Pomodoro Timer Project

This project is a Pomodoro Timer built using Next.js, Prisma, Nexus, and GraphQL with Apollo Client and Yoga GraphQL.

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique aims to improve focus, productivity, and time management.

## Features

- Start and stop the Pomodoro timer.
- Set the duration for Pomodoro sessions and breaks.
- Keep track of completed Pomodoro sessions.
- View statistics and progress.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and building modern web applications.
- Prisma: An open-source database toolkit for working with databases in a type-safe and efficient way.
- Nexus: A code-first GraphQL schema construction library for TypeScript and JavaScript.
- Apollo Client: A powerful GraphQL client for consuming GraphQL APIs.
